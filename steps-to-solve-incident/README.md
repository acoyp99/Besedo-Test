# Troubleshooting and Resolve

## Initial Response:

1. Immediate Actions:

- Acknowledge the incident alert to notify the monitoring system and team that someone is looking into it.
- Pull up system dashboards to get a quick overview of system health.
- Inform the incident response team to be on standby.

2. Tools/Strategies:

- Incident Management System (like PagerDuty or Opsgenie) to handle alerts.
- System Monitoring Dashboards (like Grafana, Datadog, or New Relic) to view real-time system metrics.

## Investigation:

1. Process:

- Check the application logs to identify any recent changes or errors.
- Examine system metrics for abnormal spikes or drops in traffic, CPU, memory, or disk usage.
- Review recent deployments or changes. Correlate the timing of any changes with the onset of latency.
- Identify if specific services or components are the latency bottlenecks.

2. Tools/Strategies:

- Log Management Tools (like ELK Stack, Splunk, or Loggly) to aggregate and analyze logs.
- Application Performance Management (APM) tools (like New Relic or Dynatrace) to trace requests and pinpoint latency.

## Resolution:

1. Process:

- If a recent deployment is the cause, consider rolling back to a stable version.
- If a particular service is overwhelmed, consider scaling it horizontally or vertically.
- If it's an external service causing the delay, contact the service provider or switch to a backup service if available.

2. Tools/Strategies:

- Continuous Deployment Tools (like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Spinnaker) to rollback deployments.
- Infrastructure as Code tools (like Terraform or CloudFormation) to quickly scale resources.
- Cloud Provider Management Console/Dashboards to manage and monitor infrastructure.

## Communication:

1. Process:

- Provide initial communication to stakeholders, explaining there's an identified latency issue and it's being addressed.
- Offer regular updates, even if it's to say the investigation is ongoing.
- Once resolved, send a communication detailing the resolution and immediate next steps.

2. Tools/Strategies:

- Communication platforms (like Slack or Microsoft Teams) for real-time team collaboration.
- Status Page (like Atlassian Statuspage or Cachet) to communicate incident status to users and stakeholders.

## Postmortem/Review:

1. Process:

- Conduct a blameless postmortem meeting with the involved parties.
- Identify root causes, not just symptoms.
- Document the incident, the response, findings, and actions taken.
- Determine actionable items to prevent recurrence.
- Prioritize and implement those actionable items.

2. Tools/Strategies:

- Collaboration tools (like Confluence or Google Docs) to document findings.
- Issue Trackers (like JIRA or Asana) to track action items and improvements.
- Continuous Improvement methodologies, such as Kaizen or Lean, to implement systemic improvements.
